            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14156:18"/> grace, which hee hath eſtabliſhed on earth, for to put in excution his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>To the end that wee may lead a peaceable and quiet life in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</hi> To the obſeruation of which ordinances, this Soueraigne power is ſo much the more obliged, for that the Prince ſinneth not by tranſgreſſion onely, but alſo by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, whereunto ſubiects vſually conforme themſelues. For this cauſe is he commanded to obſerue the Law in theſe words,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee ſhall write for him a Copie of this Law in a booke,</hi> and after, <hi>He ſhall take heed to all the words of this Law, and to theſe statutes for to do them.</hi> Now this commandement is giuen to the King, not as to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſon, to whom it ſufficeth to ſubiect himſelfe to it, but as to a king, for to reduce others to obedience thereto. By vertue whereof he ought to chaſtiſe thoſe Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that bee corrupters of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> according as it is written. <hi>When there ſhall ariſe in the midst of thee any Prophet or dreamer of dreames</hi> (ſuch as

                  <hi>Wee know</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iraeneus) that the Scriptures are perfect, for they are indited by the word of God, and by his Spirit.</hi> For theſe cauſes the Kings power is limited vnto this onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which conteineth in two Tables the rules of piety and iuſtice: the moſt ſolide and fundamentall pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of State, which at all times, thoſe men haue kept inuiolate, which in all things elſe obeyed the Prince. So

                  <hi>Daniel</hi> and his companions refuſed to proſtrate themſelues before the image of <hi>Nebuchadneſar.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Exo. 1.17.21.</note> and put the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> children to death, for that was againſt the ſecond Table of the Law of God, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> Therefore it is written:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.21.</note> 
                  <hi>And becauſe the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues feared God, therefore hee made them houſes:</hi> So ſaid that conſtant Martyr,<note place="margin">2. Maccab. 7.30.</note> 
                  <hi>I will not obey the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but I will obey the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Law that was giuen vnto our fathers by</hi> Moſes. So for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man (although he was a Prophet) rather then God,<note place="margin">1. King. 13.</note> the man of God was torne in pieces of a Lyon. The impiety and wickedneſſe of <hi>Iezabels</hi> commandement, who had ordeined that the Prophets ſhould bee ſlaine, hindred <hi>Abdias</hi> from executing it. For ſeeing that the king in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14156:19"/> is as a Father of a family in his houſe, and God will haue vs to loue him more then our owne bloud: it ſufficeth the king that we render vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the ſeruice that children owe to their moſt deere parents, ſeeing that the honour due vnto him is comprehended vnder the name of Father and Mother. Which is a thing ſo imprinted in the hearts of good men, that the light of Lawyers, <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinian,</hi> though he were not inſtructed in the Law of God, refuſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Caracalla</hi> to excuſe the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hee had committed in the perſon of his brother, ſaying, that it is not ſo eaſy to excuſe an homicide, as to commit it. By which anſwere he ſheweth, that they doe falſely call themſelues Chriſtians, which cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize murtherers, and eaſily approue the Parricides which they haue hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed. And foraſmuch as ſuch bounds are ſet by him, which giueth and taketh away Kingdomes, on ſuch conditions as pleaſeth him, good Princes which haue deſired the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14156:20"/> of their eſtates, haue not hindred the courſe of iuſtice, nor bound the hands of the Magiſtrates eſtabliſhed by them, when they would execute their charges; Haue alſo taken in good part the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, that the Paſtors of the Church haue giuen them for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of piety: for as it is ſaid of the great Citty <hi>Troy,</hi> that it could not bee deſtroyed till firſt they had loſt their Tutelary Gods.<note place="margin">Peritura Troia per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Deos.</note> So may wee aſwell and with more ſuerty ſay, that it is a moſt aſſured token of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of a State at hand, when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ill obſerued, and iuſtice not well adminiſtred. The Prince then is not aboue the Law of God, for it commeth from his Superiour: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aboue the law of nature, which cannot bee aboliſhed but with the aboliſhing of nature it ſelfe.

For this reaſon good Princes, the better to containe their ſubiects in their duties, haue brought themſelues to liue according to the Lawes, principally according to them which are of the State, and fundamentall of their ſoueraignty; as ſaid the Emperour <hi>Traian,</hi> girding the ſword on his high Conſtable, <hi>Draw it forth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for mee, if I command according to the Lawes: but if I do the contrary, employ it againſt mee.</hi> But although ſuch ſubalternall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, are aſwell Officers of the Empire, as of the Emperour, yet it is not therewith permitted them to controule the actions of their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; eſpecially when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall vices, which paſſe not into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude, and which bring not ruine to the whole ſtate; and ſuch as Princes render an account of to God alone. <hi>Tibi ſoli,</hi>

That Eccleſiaſticall perſons dwelling in a Kingdome, are not the Princes ſubiects, and cannot bee iudged by them, though they iudge Princes.</hi> Now who is it that ſeeth not the iugling deceit of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites throughout the Chapters of this Treatiſe? neither can the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bring any reaſon to the contrary: and although wee agree in this, that Kings are ordained of God <hi>for the people,</hi> yet wee muſt diſcouer the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of theſe Doctors equiuocating in the word <hi>for,</hi> which is applyable both waies, to ſerue and to command.

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:14156:54"/> who haue oftentimes ſet all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on fire and in bloud, knowing that ſuch ſpots reſpect not them, no more then the Apoſtle-ſhip receiueth blame by the treaſon of <hi>Iudas.</hi> For the faithfull Paſtours ſighed in their time, to ſee ſuch a diſorder in Church, wherein vice carried away the moſt part of the world. Alſo from time to time not onely the Kings Officers, but the beſt among the Clergy alſo, haue oppoſed themſelues; that they might reſtraine ſuch vſurpations: Although on the other ſide the Pope ſet vp new orders, depending on him in ſuch ſort, that they durſt Preach none otherwiſe then hee liſted; and them that flattered him moſt were the beſt Beneficed. So diſobedience to parents was followed, with rebellion againſt the Magiſtrate, yea againſt the Prince; ſo farre as to ſay, that it was neceſſary to ſaluation to beleeue that the Pope is God on earth: To take away which falſe opinion, and to hinder leaſt in conſequence of the ſame any attempt againſt our Kings, I haue reported
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14156:54"/> ſome actions of Popes, which ſhew that they bee very farre off from that holineſſe they pretend. This is the onely end of this Treatiſe, and not the deſire to blame any of that order: would to God they had bene the true ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, ſo much would I haue honoured them in their charge, as I deteſt the vicious. But ſeeing wee are in proceſſe betweene the King and this new power, wee muſt agree vpon a Iudge ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to them both, for to ground their rights. And as the King hath here aboue verified his right by the Law and by the Goſpell, by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Law of Nations, and the Ciuill Law, not making vſe of the Sentences of his Soueraigne Courts, and of his Statutes. So alſo I thinke that euery man of ſound iudgement will beleeue, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ought not to ground his mixt power vpon the Canon Law, for that were to bee iudge in his owne cauſe, &amp; to alleage vſurpations for good titles. The ſame iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt we giue of the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14156:55"/> of all the domeſticke witneſſes and penſionaries of the Pope, infected with the new maximes of the Canon-law, brought in ſince fiue hundred yeares, whoſe teſtimonie hee produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the beginning of his booke. Which may ſerue for anſwere in a word, againſt all ſuch depoſitions of reproachable witneſſes. And hereby is cleerely manifeſted, that the Pope hath not whereon to ground his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, neither in diuine nor humane law, or right, ſeeing that his owne is not authenticall to his profite. But if hee will be obeyed, let him imitate our Sauiour, who grounded his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on an irrefragable proofe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Saint <hi>Iohn, I ſeeke not the witneſſe of men.

And if it bee ſufficient, whence commeth it, that till our Sauiours comming in the fleſh, that is, for the ſpace of foure thouſand yeares, his pretended au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was neuer heard of? And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter CHRIST till the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> were nothing but horrible perſecutions, for the ſpace of about three hundred yeares; yet there was no ſpeech of diſpoſſeſſing <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> nor <hi>Nero,</hi> or their ſucceſſors.

Alſo there is not any Iudge ſo vniuſt, will be ſo rigorous to a husband, that accuſeth his wife of adultery, as to condemne him to liue with her, onely becauſe in pleading he calleth her his wife.

               <p>Seeing then there is appeale from the Pope, who is it can endure him to be a Soueraigne; no not in ſpirituall things:<note place="margin">Note this.</note> for it is the argument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

               <p>There is therefore no ground for this power in the Law of God, nor in the Law of man: for as no Prince gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth any priuiledge againſt himſelfe, ſo neuer any King nor Emperour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſuch a right to the Pope, which cannot be alienated.</p>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14156:90"/> haue performed this duty, yet not hauing the knowledge of Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, nor an intention to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the ſame, they haue reſpected only their owne particular, that they might preſerue their policies; and therefore ſuch vertues meerly, moral, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable before the throne of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; <hi>For whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So we may ſay that the equall diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpoile among theeues, is not a true execution of iuſtice, but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow therof, that there ſociety may the longer continue, which if contention ſhould ariſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could not long endure. And therfore as the final cauſe is vitious, ſo the meanes wherby they attaine the ſame, ought not to be held lawfull: In like maner, all friendſhip &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>binations practiſed among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is not done with conſideration of the ordinance of God, is a conſpiracy, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate complotment and confederacie, and not a legall ſociety nor religious charity,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>which ſeeketh not her owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular profite,</hi> but executeth her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects outwards. For there is no vnion,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14156:91"/> neither in faith, nor in charity, ſauing in IESVS CHRIST alone, who is the center and perpetuall end of all good; to which purpoſe ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <hi>whether yee eate or drinke, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer yee do, do all to the glory of God:</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> recommending ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the Prince, referreth it to his vſe:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.13.14. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Be yee ſubiect for the Lords ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as the morall vertues of the heathen are ſinnes before God, in as much as they are not done, with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard to his commandement, which they know not: So the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the King, who hath right ouer the ſubiect by the law of God, ariſeth onely in the minde of him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth the authour of the Law: And by the ſame reaſon it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that ſuch a man hath firſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his faith towards God, before he faile in the ſeruice of the King; for ſo long as hee remaineth faithfull in the firſt Table, hee will not paſſe to the tranſgreſſion of the ſecond; which is not well obſerued, but in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the firſt, of which it is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14156:91"/> and neceſſary dependancy.</p>
               <p>Wherefore wee ſee ordinarily that idolaters do eaſily rebell, yea boldly attempt againſt the perſon of their King: on the contrarie, Religous ſoules ſerue them, though they bee froward, yea Infidels, as wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome examples; but after the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the honour due to God, the contempt of the King followeth ſoone after.</p>
               <p>Thus is <hi>Samuel</hi> comforted by God: <hi>They haue not caſt thee away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 8.7.8.</note> 
                  <hi>but they haue caſt mee away, that I ſhould not raigne ouer them: And as they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken mee, ſeruing ſtrange Gods, euen ſo they forſake thee.</hi> And <hi>Zedechias</hi> being tributary King, before he came to deſpiſe the King, hardened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt God.<note place="margin">2. Chron. 36.12.13.</note> Zedechias <hi>did euill in the ſight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himſelfe for</hi> Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah <hi>the Prophet ſpeaking in the name of the Lord, and alſo rebelled against King</hi> Nebuchadnezar, <hi>which had cauſed him to ſweare by the name of God.</hi>

               <p>Alſo in another place, the Holy Ghoſt interpreteth rebellion to be an euill as dangerous as to goe to ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and witches, <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft, and tranſgreſſion is wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and idolatry.</hi>

               <p>Thence it commeth, that of late, ſome of them that labour to weaken the authority of the King, and haue foſtered rebellion in this Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> haue alſo queſtioned the Pythoniſſe woman poſſeſſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the Diuell: Wherefore wee need not wonder if they that like not the right way directing to <hi>Holy Abba Father which art in heauen,</hi> ſwerue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obedience of our <hi>Abimelec,</hi> that is to ſay, our <hi>Father the King,</hi> which is on earth.</p>
               <p>And as the Ieſuites ſubſtitute to God our <hi>Holy Father,</hi> another God on earth, whom they call <hi>Most holy Father,</hi> and ſeparate IESVS CHRIST from his Body &amp; Spouſe the Church, for to create vnto him a Vicar and Liuetenant generall in all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,<note place="margin">Bel. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Pontif. cap. <hi>9.</hi>

               <p>Thus hauing begunne with diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards God they end with rebellion againſt the King his Liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant on earth. Wherefore none will euer defend the Kings rights and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues as they ought, except hee firſt beginne with the Lawes of God: and if hee bee a preuaricator in the firſt Table he will eaſiy be perſwaded to lay ſuch grounds as ouerthrow the Kings right: for hee that granteth the greater, will not ſticke to giue the leſſer.</p>
               <p>This is the cunning deuiſe <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> vſed, who as it is written, retained the people to himſelfe,<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>It followeth, that the Cardinall Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite maintaineth a formall hereſie,<note place="margin">Bellar. li. <hi>3.</hi> recognit. de Laicis.</note> in making ſome Chriſtians ſubiect to the King, not for conſcience ſake, but for ſeruile feare, obeying for no other cauſe but for that they are not the ſtrongeſt, and for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not for loue of God.

               <p>Of this Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> writing to <hi>his

Hitherto, though according to my ſmall ability, I haue omitted no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by word and deed to teſtifie the ſeruice I owe your Maieſty; Yet haue
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14156:99"/> I euer remained dumbe, not daring to repreſent vnto your Maieſty by mouth the true feeling I haue had of my duty: And I ſhould for euer haue bene ſilent, had I not feared to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to giue conſent to the perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of a certaine damnable errour, Canonized of late; which would ſtill remaine vnder the aſhes of ſuch decrees, if it had not bene diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by ſome incendiaries come forth thence, who with the firebrands and bellowes of ſome controuerſies in religion, haue cauſed the fires that haue ſince fifty yeares bene ſeene in <hi>France.</hi> And whilſt good <hi>French-men</hi> were buſied, wearied, and weakned in quenching theſe flames, theſe men haue taken opportunity, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to ſeize vpon the State; and done all they could to roote out the Royall race, and to tranſ-ferre the Crowne vnto ſtrangers: Vnto which not being able to attaine by maine force, hauing ſo powerfull an enemy as King <hi>Henry</hi> the great and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they haue aduiſed themſelues of

            <p>Theſe deteſtable actes make mee cry out, <hi>O man of ſinne kill no more our Kings.</hi> If I ſhould bee ſilent I were worthy to be condemned to dye: for if the ſubiect that heareth in wordes ſome complot againſt the ſafety of his Prince, makes himſelfe guilty if he declare it not vnto him: how could he excuſe himſelfe which by reading of bookes, and diſcourſe of reaſon perceiueth whence ſuch vnnaturall attempts do proceed, if hee contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not his ſpeach, his induſtry and the perill of his life, to auert and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ſuch outrages in time to come?</p>
            <p>But ſeeing it is loſt labour to cry vnto this euill ſpirit; who is not ruled by the military diſcipline of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to giue ouer the ſlaughter at the ſound of retraite; I will turne my ſelfe to

Vſe againe the remedies, which your Predeceſſor <hi>Phillip, Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> haue done, before theſe new garriſons of ſtrangers were brought into the land, who take an oath of blind obedience to a forraine power out of the Kingdome, a fourth vow vnknowne to other orders: who creepe in and inſinuate themſelues with a wonderfull violence into the capitall Cities and beſt families, yea euen into the Metropolitane City of the Realme, who augment and make greater the preſumptuous boldneſſe of them that would precede Princes, be equall with Parliaments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14156:100"/> the function whereunto they are called. Whence commeth it elſe, that in former ages in the time of <hi>Phillip</hi> the Faire, and other ſucceding Kings, no <hi>French-man</hi> reuolted from the obedience of his Prince, for feare of a friuolous excommunication? and that in this latter age, that illuſion hath retained ſo long time in obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſo many peoples?

            <p>And although King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great followed onely the ſteppes of his Predeceſſours, and the deciſions of Catholicke Doctors, neuertheleſſe wee haue perceiued with an extreme

            <p>The want of which regiſter, hath cauſed that the moſt generous actions of our ancient <hi>Gaules,</hi> haue remained buried in obliuion, or haue bene much
